# Dewey 200s Converter (Perl)

## Overview

This is a Perl script for converting a tab-delimited list of Dewey 23 numbers between 220 and 299 to the alternative Dewey 200s schema described in Dewey 23.

This Perl script is intended to be used in a web page context and there are sample PHP files to demonstrate that.

This code has been developed by the Winnetka-Northfield Public Library District.
